# Decentralized Public Licensing and Permit Management System

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing professional licenses, business permits, and public event coordination using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## System Overview

This system consists of five specialized smart contracts that handle different aspects of public licensing and permit management:

### 1. Professional License Verification Contract (`professional-licenses.clar`)
- Tracks and verifies professional licenses for doctors, lawyers, contractors, and other licensed professionals
- Manages license issuance, renewal, and revocation
- Provides public verification of professional credentials
- Tracks continuing education requirements and compliance

### 2. Business Permit Application Processing Contract (`business-permits.clar`)
- Streamlines the application process for business operating permits and licenses
- Manages application workflow from submission to approval
- Tracks permit fees and payment status
- Handles permit renewals and modifications

### 3. Special Event Permit Coordination Contract (`event-permits.clar`)
- Manages permits for parades, festivals, concerts, and public gatherings
- Coordinates with multiple departments (police, fire, health)
- Tracks event capacity, safety requirements, and insurance
- Manages event scheduling and conflict resolution

### 4. Construction Permit Tracking Contract (`construction-permits.clar`)
- Monitors building permits from initial application through final inspection
- Tracks inspection schedules and results
- Manages contractor licensing requirements
- Handles permit modifications and extensions

### 5. Vendor License Management Contract (`vendor-licenses.clar`)
- Issues and tracks licenses for food trucks, street vendors, and mobile businesses
- Manages location assignments and scheduling
- Tracks health department compliance
- Handles seasonal and temporary vendor permits

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Verification**: All licenses and permits are stored on-chain for transparent verification
- **Automated Workflows**: Smart contracts handle application processing and approval workflows
- **Compliance Tracking**: Automated monitoring of renewal dates and compliance requirements
- **Public Transparency**: Citizens can verify the validity of any license or permit
- **Immutable Records**: All licensing actions are permanently recorded on the blockchain
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for administrators, inspectors, and applicants

## Contract Architecture

Each contract follows a consistent pattern:
- **Data Storage**: Efficient storage of license/permit data using maps and variables
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different user types
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and business rule enforcement
- **Events**: Detailed logging of all licensing actions
- **Public Functions**: User-facing functions for applications and renewals
- **Admin Functions**: Administrative functions for approval and management
- **Read-Only Functions**: Public verification and query functions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet CLI installed
- Node.js and npm for testing
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts

### Installation
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd decentralized-licensing-system
npm install
\`\`\`

### Testing
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

### Deployment
\`\`\`bash
clarinet deploy
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Professional License Verification
\`\`\`clarity
;; Apply for a professional license
(contract-call? .professional-licenses apply-for-license
"medical"
"Dr. Jane Smith"
"MD123456"
u1735689600) ;; expiration timestamp

;; Verify a professional license
(contract-call? .professional-licenses verify-license "MD123456")
\`\`\`

### Business Permit Application
\`\`\`clarity
;; Submit business permit application
(contract-call? .business-permits submit-application
"restaurant"
"Joe's Pizza"
"123 Main St"
u1000000) ;; fee amount

;; Check application status
(contract-call? .business-permits get-application-status u1)
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper access controls
- Input validation prevents malicious data entry
- Financial transactions are protected with appropriate checks
- Admin functions require proper authorization
- Public functions maintain data integrity
